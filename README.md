This is code for a reproducability project for the master course Deep Learning at TU Delft. We set out to reproduce part of the results by the following paper:

# Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy. Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift

The blogpost detailing our findings and explaining our process can be found at https://medium.com/@franciscocastanheira1998/paper-reproduction-batch-normalization-3afd4c44726d
